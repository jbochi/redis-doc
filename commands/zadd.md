Adds all the specified members with the specified scores to the sorted set
stored at `key`.
It is possible to specify multiple score / member pairs.
If a specified member is already a member of the sorted set, the score is
updated and the element reinserted at the right position to ensure the correct
ordering.

If `key` does not exist, a new sorted set with the specified members as sole
members is created, like if the sorted set was empty.
If the key exists but does not hold a sorted set, an error is returned.

The score values should be the string representation of a double precision
floating point number.
`+inf` and `-inf` values are valid values as well.

## Sorted sets 101

Sorted sets are sorted by their score in an ascending way.
The same element only exists a single time, no repeated elements are permitted.
The score can be modified both by `ZADD` that will update the element score, and
as a side effect, its position on the sorted set, and by `ZINCRBY` that can be
used in order to update the score relatively to its previous value.

The current score of an element can be retrieved using the `ZSCORE` command,
that can also be used to verify if an element already exists or not.

For an introduction to sorted sets, see the data types page on [sorted
sets][tdtss].

## Elements with the same score

While the same element can't be repeated in a sorted set since every element
is unique, it is possible to add multiple different elements _having the same
score_.
When multiple elements have the same score, they are _ordered lexicographically_
(they are still ordered by score as a first key, however, locally, all the
elements with the same score are relatively ordered lexicographically).

The lexicographic ordering used is binary, it compares strings as array of
bytes.

If the user inserts all the elements in a sorted set with the same score (for
example 0), all the elements of the sorted set are sorted lexicographically, and
range queries on elements are possible using the command `ZRANGEBYLEX` (Note: it
is also possible to query sorted sets by range of scores using `ZRANGEBYSCORE`).

@return

@integer-reply, specifically:

* The number of elements added to the sorted sets, not including elements
  already existing for which the score was updated.

@history

* `>= 2.4`: Accepts multiple elements.
  In Redis versions older than 2.4 it was possible to add or update a single
  member per call.

@examples

```cli
ZADD myzset 1 "one"
ZADD myzset 1 "uno"
ZADD myzset 2 "two" 3 "three"
ZRANGE myzset 0 -1 WITHSCORES
```
