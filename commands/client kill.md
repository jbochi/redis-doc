The `CLIENT KILL` command closes a given client connection identified by
ip:port.

The ip:port should match a line returned by the `CLIENT LIST` command.

Due to the single-treaded nature of Redis, it is not possible to kill a client
connection while it is executing a command.
From the client point of view, the connection can never be closed in the middle
of the execution of a command.
However, the client will notice the connection has been closed only when the
next command is sent (and results in network error).

@simple-string-reply: `OK` if the connection exists and has been closed
