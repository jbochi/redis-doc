The `CLIENT LIST` command returns information and statistics about the client
connections server in a mostly human readable format.

@return

@bulk-string-reply: a unique string, formatted as follows:

* One client connection per line (separated by LF)
* Each line is composed of a succession of property=value fields separated by a
  space character.

Here is the meaning of the fields:

* addr: address/port of the client
* fd: file descriptor corresponding to the socket
* age: total duration of the connection in seconds
* idle: idle time of the connection in seconds
* flags: client flags (see below)
* db: current database ID
* sub: number of channel subscriptions
* psub: number of pattern matching subscriptions
* multi: number of commands in a MULTI/EXEC context
* qbuf: query buffer length (0 means no query pending)
* qbuf-free: free space of the query buffer (0 means the buffer is full)
* obl: output buffer length
* oll: output list length (replies are queued in this list when the buffer is
  full)
* omem: output buffer memory usage
* events: file descriptor events (see below)
* cmd: last command played

The client flags can be a combination of:

```
O: the client is a slave in MONITOR mode
S: the client is a normal slave server
M: the client is a master
x: the client is in a MULTI/EXEC context
b: the client is waiting in a blocking operation
i: the client is waiting for a VM I/O (deprecated)
d: a watched keys has been modified - EXEC will fail
c: connection to be closed after writing entire reply
u: the client is unblocked
A: connection to be closed ASAP
N: no specific flag set
```

The file descriptor events can be:

```
r: the client socket is readable (event loop)
w: the client socket is writable (event loop)
```

## Notes

New fields are regularly added for debugging purpose.
Some could be removed in the future.
A version safe Redis client using this command should parse the output
accordingly (i.e.
handling gracefully missing fields, skipping unknown fields).
